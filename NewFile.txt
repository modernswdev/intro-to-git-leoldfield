### Task:
Create a new markdown file in this repository. Let them know what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!

### Response: 
I've never worked with Github Classroom before, so I'm learning how to work with that. I've also only used the Github Desktop app for collaboration so going through the Github site itself is new for me.
